# Cellular Automaton Simulation

This Python program simulates a cellular automaton with different types of cells, including Maniacs, Franks, Civilians, and Dead Cells. The simulation is represented in a matrix where each cell type is visually distinguishable.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.

4. Run the simulation by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
The simulation will start, and you will see the evolution of the cellular automaton over time.

## Cell Types
- Maniac: Represents a Maniac cell.
- Frank : Represents a Frank cell.
- Civilian : Represents a Civilian cell.
- Dead Cell : Represents a Dead Cell.


## Rules
- Cells evolve based on certain rules and interactions with neighboring cells.
- The simulation continues to evolve over time, demonstrating the dynamic behavior of the cellular automaton.


## Customization
- You can customize the size of the matrix by modifying the m, n variables in the code.
- The initial distribution of cell types is determined by the gender method.


## Dependencies
- The program uses the random and time modules from the Python standard library.
